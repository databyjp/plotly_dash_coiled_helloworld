# Plotly Dash + Coiled / Dask starter demo app

Dask is an open-source Python library for parallel computing and Coiled is a service that allows for the easy provisioning, scaling and management of remote Dask clusters. 
Together, these Plotly partners enable organizations to scale popular data science libraries, including Plotlyâ€™s Dash, across parallel computing clusters.

This app is designed to show how quickly an easily a Dash app using Dask on a local cluster can be converted to use a remote cluster with Coiled.
