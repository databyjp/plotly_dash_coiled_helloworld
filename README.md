# Plotly Dash + Coiled / Dask starter demo app

Dask is an open-source Python library for parallel computing and Coiled is a service that allows for the easy provisioning, scaling and management of remote Dask clusters. 
Together, these Plotly partners enable organizations to scale popular data science libraries, including Plotlyâ€™s Dash, across parallel computing clusters.

This app is designed to show how quickly an easily a Dash app using Dask on a local cluster can be converted to use a remote cluster with Coiled.

## Important Notes
- The app assumes that the user has a Coiled account, and that **their account credentials have been set up** (e.g. via `coiled login`).
See Coiled's [getting started guide](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/getting_started.html) for help.
- Just as a local Python environment is needed with the right packages, a remote environment is required at the Coiled cluster - see the getting started guide, or Coiled's guide on [creating software environments](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/software_environment_creation.html).
